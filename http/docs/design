1. Split clients request by new line into an array of n new lines
2. Find the index where the first request header i.e GET or HEAD has been found
3. Once found further parse the rest of the requests
4. Split first line into req(GET or HEAD) path and protocol
5. path will take the full host portion in the request header and substring everything after \
6. find Host and get the host
7. find where the connection is and get the string i.e close or Keep-Alive
6. save an index reference to first request header, host and connection
7. if any of these aren't given abort request and send error message(bad request) to client
8. if a website is forbidden also abort and send an error message(forbidden url) to client
9. if request method is any other than HEAD or GET abort then send error message (Method not allowed)
10. The main function execute will return 0 for connection close and 1 for connection open after the transaction has been completed
11. on each requested event a log will be loged into access.log with such format <date-format> <client-ip> <request-first-line> <http-status-code> <object-size-in-byte>
12. on each accept the proxy_server will fork to be concurrent and pron to crash
